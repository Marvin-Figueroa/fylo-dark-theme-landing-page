# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page solution

This is my solution to the [Fylo dark theme landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma sketch file, so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
